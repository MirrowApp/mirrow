![CI](https://github.com/MirrowApp/mirrow/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Mirrow is a playground and production tooling for vector animators working with integrating motion, and interaction seemlessly into their workflow. Instead of treating SVGs as static assets, Mirrow gives them the starring role in your workflow. Describe shapes, styling, animation, and even interaction logic in one expressive format that compiles seamlessly.

## Why Mirrow feels different âœ¨

- SVGs are treated as first-class citizens rather than static assets.
- A familiar, designer-friendly syntax.
- Animation, state, and styling live together.
- Simple variable support.
- Output slots into your applications for a seemless adoption.

```css
svg {
  size: (150, 150)

  rect {
    at: (20, 20)
    size: (100px, 100px)  // px string now validated
    radius: (8, 8)
    stroke: #333
    strokeWidth: 2
    id: "box"
  }

  @hover {
    #box { stroke: #0070f3; strokeWidth: 3 }
  }
}
```

## Getting started ðŸš€

```bash
# Compile a Mirrow file to SVG without installing anything locally
npx mirrow -i icon.mirrow -o icon.svg

# Mirror an entire directory of Mirrow sources into a build output
npx mirrow -i src/mirrow -o dist/icons --depth unbound
```

The CLI reads the Mirrow source at `icon.mirrow` and writes the compiled SVG to
`icon.svg`. Point the `-o` flag at your framework adapter (React, Svelte, etc.)
to generate components instead of raw SVG. When a directory is supplied via
`-i`, Mirrow preserves the directory structure, compiling every `.mirrow` file
to `.svg` and copying any other assets alongside them. Control how deep the
recursion goes with `--depth` (use `unbound` to traverse every nested folder).

The project is organized as a monorepo:

- `@mirrowjs/core` â€“ the Mirrow compiler, parser, and language experiments.
- `@mirrow/cli` â€“ a lightweight CLI that will grow alongside the language.
